For my capstone, I made a Christmas Wishlist app, it can:

- Use multiple Users, both of the user and admin roles,
- Create, read, update, and delete events, wishlists, categories, and items
- Handle gift buying reservations to ensure duplicate gifts are not bought
- And more!

This semester I was super happy to jump back into python, as it's maybe my favorite language, and I learned mostly how to use authentication, which is a big deal to me. Overall my favorite part of class was definitely the codealongs, because we got to debug togetherin real time.
